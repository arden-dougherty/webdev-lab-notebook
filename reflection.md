## Reflection Document

### HTML

These exercises were really helpful for learning the basics of HTML. I always feel like the hardest part of learning a new language or topic is getting started, and this week helped get me past that point. I was able to complete the first three exercises using only the documentation on web.dev, but for the last exercise I had to look to the code samples, as there weren't as many specific examples about forms on web.dev. Overall I feel like everything was explained well enough for me to grasp it, but I think it might be useful for me to practice some more with forms.

### Accessibility

We had covered most of the tools needed to complete this exercise in class and in the first homework assignment, so it felt pretty simple to do. We went over ARIA a little bit in class, but I still feel like I don't really understand it, so it might have been helpful to do some exercises with ARIA.

### CSS

I think these exercises were very helpful for learning the fundamentals of CSS. I used the code samples a lot to help with the exercises. The most difficult for me was the position exercise, and getting the absolute and fixed positions to work correctly.

### Flexbox

Flexbox proved to be a super useful tool for my assignments in this class, and I think the exercises here did a good job of demonstrating the different things that flexbox can do. For the most part I was able to complete these exercises on my own, but the last exercise was a little confusing. For all of the other layouts, you have to use a smaller screen size to match the screenshots. However, I couldn't find a way to make the last layout look correct with that smaller screen size.

### Grid

I found the grid exercises easy to complete with just the lecture material and the documentation. I think they were sufficienctly helpful for learning how to use CSS grid.

### Bootstrap

To get started with the first bootstrap exercise I had to watch the video, but after that I found the exercises fairly simple to complete. I found the bootstrap grid fairly straightforward after having experience with the normal CSS grid and flexbox. The bootstrap documentation was very helpful for these exercises.

### JavaScript

I found the JavaScript exercises more difficult than most of the previous exercies. I had to use the videos to complete the last exercise, but the others I was able to do on my own.

The templates for some of the functions were a little confusing. For example, in the 07-functional exercise, the functions are set up to take an array as input and return that same array. However, if one of the functions modifies the array then the other functions don't work. This is easy to modify, but the way the functions are written makes it seem like you're supposed to do it that way.

### Jquery

I had to use the videos to complete both of the Jquery exercises, but after doing so I feel much more confident about using Jquery on my own.
