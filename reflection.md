## Reflection Document

### HTML

These exercises were really helpful for learning the basics of HTML. I always feel like the hardest part of learning a new language or topic is getting started, and this week helped get me past that point. I was able to complete the first three exercises using only the documentation on web.dev, but for the last exercise I had to look to the code samples, as there weren't as many specific examples about forms on web.dev. Overall I feel like everything was explained well enough for me to grasp it, but I think it might be useful for me to practice some more with forms.

### Accessibility

We had covered most of the tools needed to complete this exercise in class and in the first homework assignment, so it felt pretty simple to do. We went over ARIA a little bit in class, but I still feel like I don't really understand it, so it might have been helpful to do some exercises with ARIA.
