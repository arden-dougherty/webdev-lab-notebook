### HTML

These exercises were really helpful for learning the basics of HTML. I always feel like the hardest part of learning a new language or topic is getting started, and this week helped get me past that point. I was able to complete the first three exercises using only the documentation on web.dev, but for the last exercise I had to look to the code samples, as there weren't as many specific examples about forms on web.dev. Overall I feel like everything was explained well enough for me to grasp it, but I think it might be useful for me to practice some more with forms.
